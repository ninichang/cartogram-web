# Cartogram Web Visualization Project

This project uses the cartogram generation algorithm written by Gastner et. al. in 2018 to create an interactive cartogram-generating website. To get the website running locally on your computer, please follow the Linux or Mac OS X setup guide in the `doc/` folder in this repository.

To add a map to the website, please follow the Add Map Wizard guide at `doc/addmap/addmap.md`.
